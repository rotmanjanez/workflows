# Upgrade Guide

This document describes breaking changes and how to upgrade. For a complete list
of changes, including minor and patch releases, please refer to the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

### `reusable-cpp-tests.yml` replaces the three per-platform workflows and owns the matrix

`reusable-cpp-tests-ubuntu.yml`, `reusable-cpp-tests-macos.yml`, and
`reusable-cpp-tests-windows.yml` are gone. C++ tests are now a single job:

```yaml
cpp-tests:
  name: 🇨 Test
  uses: munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-cpp-tests.yml@v3
  secrets: inherit
  permissions:
    contents: read
    id-token: write
```

The platforms and configurations are no longer configurable. The workflow runs
`release` on `ubuntu-24.04`, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `macos-26`, `windows-2025`, and
`windows-11-arm`, plus `debug` on the three x86 ones, and picks the `-windows`
preset suffix itself. Draft pull requests run the Linux `debug` build only. This
is the matrix eight of the ten C++ projects already spelled out by hand.

It also runs coverage, so `reusable-cpp-coverage.yml` no longer needs its own
job; pass `enable-coverage: false` to opt out.

Migrating a caller:

- Replace the `cpp-tests` matrix, its `runs-on`/`compiler`/`preset-name`/
  `run-on-draft` inputs, and the `cpp-coverage` job with the job above.
- `mlir-debug` is gone: only the Windows debug build needs a debug MLIR, and the
  workflow derives that itself.
- Update branch protection: job names now come from the workflow, not your
  matrix.

Windows C++ test jobs now initialize native MSVC and build with Ninja instead of
the Visual Studio generator, so the job-local sccache applies there as well. No
preset change is required as long as your `base-windows` preset leaves the
generator unset, as the reference presets below do -- `CMAKE_GENERATOR` fills it
in. A preset that names `"generator": "Visual Studio 17 2022"` explicitly still
wins, and simply keeps building uncached. The `-windows` presets are otherwise
redundant now, but they remain supported and the workflow keeps selecting them.

Windows Debug builds are configured with
`-DCMAKE_MSVC_DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT=Embedded`, because sccache cannot cache a
compilation that writes a separate PDB. This requires `CMP0141` to be `NEW`
(that is, `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25)` or later); on an older policy
the setting is ignored and Windows Debug builds simply stay uncached.

They are also configured with `-DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreadedDLL`,
which keeps the release CRT in Debug (needs `CMP0091` to be `NEW`). That is what
lets the Debug build link against the release MLIR, as every other platform
already did, so no debug MLIR is downloaded any more. The MSVC debug CRT is what
made a matching debug MLIR necessary; with the release CRT the mismatch is gone.
Note that this turns off MSVC iterator debugging, which the Linux and macOS
Debug builds never had either.

On Windows, `compiler: clang` now actually builds with clang-cl. The Windows
workflow documented this behavior but never implemented it, so `compiler: clang`
silently built with MSVC. It was briefly implemented via
`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET=ClangCL`, which Ninja does not accept.

### `reusable-python-tests.yml` owns the test matrix

Python tests are likewise a single job, with the same shape of change:

```yaml
python-tests:
  name: 🐍 Test
  needs: python-build # only for projects with a compiled extension
  uses: munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-python-tests.yml@v3
  with:
    compiled: true # only for projects with a compiled extension
  secrets: inherit
  permissions:
    contents: read
    id-token: write
```

`python-versions` (default `'["3.11", "3.12", "3.13", "3.14"]'`, oldest first)
sets the interpreter window; the shape of the matrix is not configurable. Linux
(x86) runs every listed version. Linux ARM, macOS, and Windows run the oldest
and newest versions. Windows ARM is not part of the test matrix: Qiskit
publishes no arm64 Windows wheels, so no test session can install its
dependencies there. Compiled projects still smoke-test their arm64 Windows wheel
in the build workflow. The `minimums` session runs on Linux and Windows (x86) at
the two boundaries. Drafts run one job on the newest interpreter. Coverage runs
here too.

`runs-on`, `python-version`, `sessions`, and `wheels-artifact` are gone. So is
`draft-sessions`, which now fails the run instead of silently promoting drafts
to the full matrix. Repository-specific sessions belong in a job of their own.

Compiled projects pass `compiled: true` instead of `wheels-artifact`; the
workflow derives the artifact name and needs `reusable-python-build.yml` to have
run first.

### `reusable-python-build.yml` owns packaging

The sdist, the pure-Python wheel, and the cibuildwheel fan-out are one job:

```yaml
python-build:
  name: 🐍 Build
  uses: munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-python-build.yml@v3
  with:
    compiled: true # only for projects with a compiled extension
  secrets: inherit
```

It replaces per-platform `reusable-python-packaging-wheel-cibuildwheel.yml` jobs
and the separate sdist and wheel jobs. Drafts build the Linux wheel only.

### `reusable-python-tests.yml` tests prebuilt wheels instead of compiling

All compiler machinery (MSVC developer shell, the Ninja override, mold, sccache)
and the "Free up space" steps are gone. Compiled projects instead pass the new
`wheels-artifact` input, naming the artifact
`reusable-python-packaging-wheel-cibuildwheel.yml` built for the same platform
(including the `dev-` prefix on pull requests). The workflow downloads it, sets
uv's `UV_FIND_LINKS` and `UV_CONSTRAINT` — pinned to the exact version found in
the wheelhouse, so an empty or stale artifact fails the job instead of falling
through to PyPI — and exports `MQT_WHEELHOUSE` pointing at the directory. When
no artifact is passed, none of these are set and sessions build from source, as
intended for pure-Python projects.

**This requires a change to the noxfile.** `uv sync` always installs the root
project from the local tree, and no environment variable overrides that: not
`UV_NO_SOURCES`, not `UV_NO_BUILD_PACKAGE`. A session that syncs the project
therefore performs a full C++ build in every test job, wheelhouse or not. Guard
the sync on `MQT_WHEELHOUSE` and install the package separately:

```python
if os.environ.get("MQT_WHEELHOUSE"):
    session.run("uv", "sync", "--inexact", "--no-dev", "--no-install-project", env=env)
    session.run("uv", "pip", "install", "--python", session.virtualenv.location,
                "<package>", env=env)
else:
    session.run("uv", "sync", "--inexact", "--no-dev",
                "--no-build-isolation-package", "<package>", env=env)
```

`UV_FIND_LINKS` and `UV_CONSTRAINT` then resolve `<package>` to the wheel that
was just built. Anything the source build needed but the wheel path does not —
installing `cmake` and `ninja`, for instance — should be skipped in the same
branch.

Sessions get a regular, non-editable install, so coverage is measured inside
`site-packages` and Codecov would report zero diff coverage on pull requests.
Map the paths back in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.coverage.paths]
source = ["src/<package>", "*/site-packages/<package>"]
```

Sessions that relied on an editable install (importing test helpers from the
source tree, patching installed files) need the same treatment.

### Compiler and uv caching is always on

`reusable-python-packaging-wheel-cibuildwheel.yml` (on macOS and Windows —
manylinux containers cannot reach a host sccache), `reusable-cpp-coverage.yml`,
and `reusable-cpp-linter.yml` share compiler results through capped,
run-id-keyed Actions cache entries that every run restores and saves — pull
requests included, since Actions caches are branch-scoped and a pull request
never reads a sibling's cache. The uv caches follow the same policy: pruned,
keyed uniquely per workflow and matrix entry, and saved on every run instead of
only on `main`.

This supersedes the note in [2.2.1](#221) that "compiler results are not stored
between jobs or workflow runs" and replaces the previous uncapped caches that
permanently overflowed the 10 GB per-repository budget. Callers need no changes,
but repositories may want to delete the old `c++-coverage_*` and `c++-lint_*`
entries once (Actions → Caches) to free the budget immediately.

## [2.3.0]

The Python test workflow now accepts `sessions` and `draft-sessions` as
JSON-formatted lists of Nox sessions. `sessions` is used for ready pull requests
and non-pull-request events and defaults to `["minimums", "tests"]`.
`draft-sessions` is used for draft pull requests and defaults to
`["tests-3.14"]`.

For example, the following matrix runs the `tests` session for every supported
Python version on ready pull requests and other events, but only the Python 3.14
session on drafts:

```yaml
python-tests:
  name: 🐍 Test
  strategy:
    fail-fast: false
    matrix:
      runs-on:
        [
          ubuntu-24.04,
          ubuntu-24.04-arm,
          macos-26,
          macos-26-intel,
          windows-2025,
        ]
  uses: munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-python-tests.yml@v2.3.0
  with:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runs-on }}
    sessions: '["tests"]'
    draft-sessions: '["tests-3.14"]'
```

The C++ test workflows for Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows now accept a
`run-on-draft` input. It defaults to `true` for backward compatibility. Set it
to `false` for jobs that should be skipped entirely on draft pull requests, such
as release builds or a Linux x86 build already covered by the coverage job. A
matrix can select this per configuration.

For example, this Linux matrix skips its x86 debug build because it is covered
by the coverage job and its ARM release build because it is not needed on
drafts:

```yaml
cpp-tests-ubuntu:
  name: 🇨 Test 🐧
  strategy:
    fail-fast: false
    matrix:
      include:
        - runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
          compiler: gcc
          preset: debug
          run-on-draft: false
        - runs-on: ubuntu-24.04-arm
          compiler: gcc
          preset: release
          run-on-draft: false
  uses: munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-cpp-tests-ubuntu.yml@v2.3.0
  with:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runs-on }}
    compiler: ${{ matrix.compiler }}
    preset-name: ${{ matrix.preset }}
    run-on-draft: ${{ matrix.run-on-draft }}
```

By default, GitHub does not run `pull_request` workflows when a pull request is
marked ready for review or converted back to a draft. To run the appropriate
sessions whenever the draft status changes, add `ready_for_review` and
`converted_to_draft` to the pull request activity types in `ci.yml`. Specifying
`types` replaces the defaults, so retain `opened`, `reopened`, and
`synchronize`:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, ready_for_review]
```

## [2.2.2]

This release updates [pypa/cibuildwheel] to `v4.2.0`. As a result, CPython 3.15
wheels are built by default. Consumers may need to skips tests for `cp315-*` in
their `cibuildwheel` configuration if any dependency does not support Python
3.15 yet.

## [2.2.1]

On Windows, `reusable-python-tests.yml` now initializes native MSVC and uses
Ninja so the installed, job-local `sccache` can reuse compiler results between
Python sessions. Compiler results are not stored between jobs or workflow runs.
Linux and macOS setup is unchanged.

To reuse a native build tree between nox sessions, projects may configure a
shared directory in `pyproject.toml`, for example:

```toml
[tool.scikit-build]
build-dir = "build/python/{build_type}"
```

Keep this directory separate from CMake preset build directories.

## [2.2.0]

This release adds a `run-python-linter` output to
`reusable-change-detection.yml`. This output is `true` when changes are made to
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, among others. This allows
`reusable-python-linter.yml` to run automatically when the `ty` hook is updated.
Consuming repositories must update their CI configuration accordingly.

## [2.1.0]

This release changes how `ty check` is run in `reusable-python-linter.yml`. With
the release of [astral-sh/ty-pre-commit], we now rely on the official pre-commit
hook and no longer support the custom `ty-check` hook. Consuming repositories
must switch to [astral-sh/ty-pre-commit].

## [2.0.3]

### Additional file inputs for change detection

This release adds `additional-cpp-files`, `additional-python-files`, and
`additional-cd-files` inputs to `reusable-change-detection.yml` to extend the
change detection. If provided, the specified files are checked in addition to
the default ones.

### Update to `cibuildwheel` v4

This release updates [pypa/cibuildwheel] to `v4.0.0`. Consumers can simplify
their `cibuildwheel` configuration:

- Remove `cp313t-*` skip selectors. `cibuildwheel` v4 no longer supports CPython
  3.13 free-threaded builds, while CPython 3.14 free-threaded builds remain
  supported.
- Remove overrides that append `uvx abi3audit --strict --report {wheel}` to the
  repair command. `cibuildwheel` v4 audits ABI3 wheels by default.
- Remove explicit `manylinux_2_28` image settings when the project does not need
  a custom image. This is `cibuildwheel` v4's default.
- Remove explicit `delvewheel` installation on Windows. `cibuildwheel` v4
  installs it by default.

Generic free-threaded test skips such as `cp3??t-*` may still be needed when
test dependencies do not provide free-threaded wheels.

## [2.0.2]

### Inheriting project-specific secrets in reusable workflows

Most reusable build, test, lint, and packaging workflows now expose a fixed
whitelist of inherited secrets as environment variables. This is intended for
projects that need to make project-specific credentials available to their CI
steps without requiring workflow-specific configuration for every consuming
repository.

To use this feature, the calling workflow needs to pass `secrets: inherit` to
the reusable workflow invocation. In addition, the calling repository or
environment needs to define the corresponding secrets under the exact same
names.

The supported names are:

- `IQM_TOKEN`
- `IQM_QC_ALIAS`
- `AWS_S3_BUCKET`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

If a project needs one of these values, define the matching repository or
environment secret and inherit secrets in the calling workflow. For example:

```yaml
python-tests:
  uses: munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-python-tests.yml@v2.0.2
  with:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
  secrets: inherit
```

Once inherited, the reusable workflow exposes the secret values as environment
variables with the same names. If one of the listed secrets is not defined by
the calling repository or environment, the corresponding environment variable is
left empty.

## [2.0.0]

This release adapts all C++ workflows to require [CMake presets], providing a
standardized and reproducible way to configure builds across different platforms
while eliminating scattered configuration with string-based arguments.

The testing workflows for macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows
(`reusable-cpp-tests-macos.yml`, `reusable-cpp-tests-ubuntu.yml`, and
`reusable-cpp-tests-windows.yml`) now require a `preset-name` input and no
longer accept `cmake-args` or `config` inputs. On Windows, the new `mlir-debug`
flag can be used for debug MLIR builds.

The coverage and linter workflows (`reusable-cpp-coverage.yml` and
`reusable-cpp-linter.yml`) require `coverage` and `lint` presets, respectively,
and no longer accept `cmake-args`.

An exemplary `CMakePresets.json` can be found below.

}
```

## [1.18.1]

To reduce complications when uploading artifacts during deployment to PyPI, we
are reverting changes made in [1.17.15]. The `pattern` passed to
[actions/upload-artifact] can be `cibw-` again.

## [1.18.0]

### Rely on MQT App secrets from `mqt-app` GitHub environment

In accordance with the latest guidelines from the [zizmor] linter, the
`reusable-mqt-core-update.yml` workflow now relies on the MQT App secrets from a
dedicated `mqt-app` GitHub environment. This means that the `APP_ID` and
`APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets are no longer read from organization-wide secrets.
Instead, they must now be configured in a dedicated `mqt-app` GitHub
environment, which needs to be created in each repository that uses the
`reusable-mqt-core-update.yml` workflow.

## [1.17.15]

Thanks to a change in [actions/upload-artifact], it is now possible to not
archive artifacts before uploading them. We make use of this in
`reusable-python-packaging-sdist.yml` and
`reusable-python-packaging-wheel-build.yml`. As a result, the `pattern` passed
to [actions/upload-artifact] has to be adjusted. For example, `cibw-` needs to
be replaced with `mqt_bench-`.

## [1.17.11]

### Removal of `run-mlir` output from change-detection

This release removes the `run-mlir` output from the change-detection step of the
`reusable-cpp-linter.yml` workflow. The output was only used in MQT Core, where
MLIR will be enabled by default with the next release. Hence, this update
includes `mlir/**` in the regular C++ file filter instead. Since this is only
affecting the MQT Core repository, this is only flagged as a patch release.

### Addition of debug builds for LLVM on Windows

With this release, the C++ testing workflows on Windows will now download a
debug build of LLVM instead of the release build. This is made possible by the
latest release of the [portable-mlir-toolchain] (`2026.01.07`) and the
[setup-mlir] action (`v1.1.0`). This enables debug builds of libraries depending
on the LLVM distributions, such as MQT Core, in debug mode on Windows without
running into ABI issues.

## [1.17.6]

### Checking Python stub files

The optional Python linter workflow for checking Python stub files has been
redesigned to rely on the presence of a nox session called `stubs`, that shall
generate the stub files. An example of such a session would be:

```python
import nox
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

@nox.session(reuse_venv=True, venv_backend="uv")
def stubs(session: nox.Session) -> None:
    """Generate type stubs for Python bindings using nanobind."""
    env = {"UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT": session.virtualenv.location}
    session.run(
        "uv",
        "sync",
        "--no-dev",
        "--group",
        "build",
        env=env,
    )

    package_root = Path(__file__).parent / "python" / "mqt" / "core"
    pattern_file = Path(__file__).parent / "bindings" / "core_patterns.txt"

    session.run(
        "python",
        "-m",
        "nanobind.stubgen",
        "--recursive",
        "--include-private",
        "--output-dir",
        str(package_root),
        "--pattern-file",
        str(pattern_file),
        "--module",
        "mqt.core.ir",
        "--module",
        "mqt.core.dd",
        "--module",
        "mqt.core.fomac",
        "--module",
        "mqt.core.na",
    )

    pyi_files = list(package_root.glob("**/*.pyi"))

    if shutil.which("prek") is None:
        session.install("prek")

    # Allow both 0 (no issues) and 1 as success codes for fixing up stubs.
    success_codes = [0, 1]
    session.run("prek", "run", "license-tools", "--files", *pyi_files, external=True, success_codes=success_codes)
    session.run("prek", "run", "ruff-check", "--files", *pyi_files, external=True, success_codes=success_codes)
    session.run("prek", "run", "ruff-format", "--files", *pyi_files, external=True, success_codes=success_codes)

    # Finally, run ruff-check again to ensure everything is clean.
    session.run("prek", "run", "ruff-check", "--files", *pyi_files, external=True)
```

## [1.17.5]

### MLIR support

This release adds support for setting up MLIR in the C++ and Python workflows
based on the newly created
[`setup-mlir` action](https://github.com/munich-quantum-software/setup-mlir). To
enable MLIR support, you can set the `setup-mlir` option to `true` in the
workflow configuration of all relevant workflows. A specific version of MLIR can
be specified by setting the `llvm-version` option, which needs to be a valid
LLVM version string (e.g., `21.1.8`) that is available via the GitHub action.
For example, the following configuration enables MLIR support with LLVM version
21.1.8 in the C++ linter workflow:

```yaml
uses: munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-cpp-linter.yml@v1.17.5
with:
  setup-mlir: true
  llvm-version: 21.1.8
```

## [1.17.3]

### Type checking with `ty`

This release fixes the `ty` linter workflow, which would always use the latest
version of `ty` available on PyPI. As `ty` is still moving pretty fast and the
latest version may not be stable yet, this was not ideal. This release changes
the behavior to use the version of `ty` listed as a development dependency in
`pyproject.toml`. If you have the `enable-ty` option set to `true` in your
workflow configuration, you **must** add `ty` to your development dependencies
or the workflow will fail.

### Additional customization for the C++ linter

This release adds the optional `cpp-linter-ignore-extra` input to the
`reusable-cpp-linter.yml` workflow. This allows ignoring additional files in the
C++ linter workflow by passing a pipe-separated list of globs. For example, to
ignore all files in the `plugin` directory and the `subdir/third_party`
directory, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml
uses: munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-cpp-linter.yml@v1.17.3
with:
  cpp-linter-ignore-extra: "plugin/**|subdir/third_party/**"
```

## [1.17.0]

This release removes all CodeQL workflows because CodeQL is now run
automatically by GitHub.

## [1.16.0]

This release updates `cibuildwheel` to `v3.1`. As a result, CPython 3.14 wheels
are built by default. As free-threading is no longer experimental, also
free-threaded wheels are built. When upgrading, ensure that the following
conditions are met:

1. `pybind11` modules are marked with `py::mod_gil_not_used()`
2. `cibuildwheel` skips tests for `cp3*t-*` (because Qiskit does not support
   free threading)
3. `cibuildwheel` skips tests for `cp314-*` (because not all dependencies
   support Python 3.14 yet)

## [1.15.0]

The `reusable-qiskit-upstream.yml` workflow has been renamed to
`reusable-qiskit-upstream-tests.yml` to align with the added
`reusable-qiskit-upstream-issue.yml` workflow. The added workflow can be used to
create an issue if the Qiskit upstream tests have failed.

## [1.14.0]

This release overwrites some of the changes released with [1.13.0].

The `reusable-cpp-ci.yml` workflow has been removed. Instead, the
`reusable-cpp-tests-ubuntu.yml`, `reusable-cpp-tests-macos.yml`, and
`reusable-cpp-tests-windows.yml` workflows should be used directly. A matrix
strategy can be defined in the workflow calling the respective test workflows.

Similarly, `reusable-python-ci.yml` workflow has been removed. The
`reusable-python-tests.yml` and `reusable-python-coverage.yml` workflows can be
used instead.

Finally, the `reusable-python-packaging.yml` workflow has been split into
`reusable-python-packaging-sdist.yml`,
`reusable-python-packaging-wheel-build.yml`, and
`reusable-python-packaging-wheel-cibuildwheel.yml`.

## [1.13.0]

This release streamlines the runner and compiler configuration in the C++ as
well as Python workflows. Instead of having an ever-growing list of options for
the C++ and Python testing as well as the Python packaging workflows, the
configuration options have been simplified. Most options have been removed and
replaced with single list options out of which the desired configuration can be
selected. Specifically, the `reusable-cpp-ci.yml` workflow now has the following
new options:

- `ubuntu-runners`: A list of Ubuntu runners to use for the C++ testing
  workflow.
- `ubuntu-compilers`: A list of compilers to use for the C++ testing workflow on
  Ubuntu.
- `ubuntu-configs`: A list of configurations to use for the C++ testing workflow
  on Ubuntu.
- `macos-runners`: A list of macOS runners to use for the C++ testing workflow.
- `macos-compilers`: A list of compilers to use for the C++ testing workflow on
  macOS.
- `macos-configs`: A list of configurations to use for the C++ testing workflow
  on macOS.
- `windows-runners`: A list of Windows runners to use for the C++ testing
  workflow.
- `windows-compilers`: A list of compilers to use for the C++ testing workflow
  on Windows.
- `windows-configs`: A list of configurations to use for the C++ testing
  workflow on Windows.

The `reusable-python-ci.yml` and the `reusable-python-packaging.yml` workflows
have also been updated with the following new option:

- `runners`: A list of runners to use for the workflow.

In addition, support for additional compilers has been added to the C++ testing
workflows. Specifically, the following compilers are now also supported:

- `clang-XX`: The Clang compiler with version `XX` (e.g., `clang-20`) on Linux
  and macOS.
- `gcc-XX`: The GCC compiler with version `XX` (e.g., `gcc-15`) on macOS.

When using the `clang-XX` compiler on Linux and macOS, the necessary
dependencies for MLIR are automatically installed. This is a first step towards
integrating MLIR into the MQT workflows.

## [1.12.0]

This release adds support for running Astral's `ty` type checker as part of the
`reusable-python-linter.yml` workflow. To enable this, you can set the `run-ty`
option to `true` in the workflow configuration. Additionally, the `mypy` type
checker can now be disabled by setting the `run-mypy` option to `false`. While
`ty` is a drop-in replacement for `mypy`, it is still in alpha and may not be as
stable as `mypy`. The current recommendation is to use `ty` and `mypy` in
parallel, as they may catch different issues. Once `ty` is stable, it can be
used as a drop-in replacement for `mypy`. Project may want to add `ty` to their
development dependencies to ensure that the same version is used for all
developers.

```commandline
uv add --dev ty
```

Furthermore, this release changes the `reusable-mqt-core-update.yml` workflow to
use a GitHub App token for creating and editing pull requests. This token has
permissions to trigger workflows in the created pull requests, which is not the
case for the default GitHub token used previously. When using the
`reusable-mqt-core-update.yml` workflow, it is now necessary to pass the
`APP_ID` and `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` as secrets.

```yaml
update-mqt-core:
  name: ⬆️ Update MQT Core
  uses: munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-mqt-core-update.yml@v1.12
  with:
    update-to-head: ${{ github.event.inputs.update-to-head == 'true' }}
  secrets:
    APP_ID: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
    APP_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Both variables are stored as organization-wide secrets and do not need to be
explicitly added to each repository.

## [1.11.0]

This release adapts the file filter for the change detection to the new project
structure regarding the Python bindings. This new project structure moves all
Python code (except tests) to the top-level `python` directory and the C++ code
for the Python bindings to the top-level `bindings` directory. Hence, the
directories `src` and `include` then contain only C++ code that is not related
to the Python bindings.

If the old directory structure is still in use, this update may trigger warnings
in C++ files when changes are made only to Python files. Additionally, pure
Python changes will not trigger the Python CI anymore using the old structure.

This release also updates `cibuildwheel` to `v3`, the latest major version
released a couple of weeks ago. Most importantly, the default manylinux images
have been updated to `manylinux_2_28`, so that the following lines are no longer
necessary in Python projects with compiled extensions.

```toml
manylinux-x86_64-image = "manylinux_2_28"
manylinux-aarch64-image = "manylinux_2_28"
manylinux-ppc64le-image = "manylinux_2_28"
manylinux-s390x-image = "manylinux_2_28"
```

In principle, this also marks the point where one could start testing Python
3.14 support, which is currently in beta.

## [1.10.0]

This release adds support for linting Python bindings. To this end, the
`reusable-cpp-linter.yml` workflow adds the option `setup-pybind11` to set up a
Python environment and install the `pybind11` package. By default, this option
is disabled. When enabled, the Python environment is activated automatically
such that CMake will find the `pybind11` package.

This change includes that all `python` subdirectories are not ignored by the
linter anymore. This may result in new warnings when the bindings are changed.
To fix this, enable the option `setup-pybind11` of the `reusable-cpp-linter.yml`
workflow and add the additional workflow argument
`cmake-args: -DBUILD_MQT_[project]_BINDINGS=ON` to the `reusable-cpp-linter.yml`
workflow step where `[project]` is the name of the project you want to build.
This will ensure that the bindings are built and the warnings are resolved.

## [1.9.0]

This release adds support for the new Windows 11 ARM runners. Since not every
tool may be compatible with the new runners, they are opt-in by default. As
such, this release allows explicitly configuring the GitHub runners that will be
used for running the Python packaging workflow. Using the default configuration,
everything will remain the same as before. That is, the workflow will run on:

- Ubuntu 24.04
- Ubuntu 24.04 ARM
- macOS 13
- macOS 14
- Windows 2022

However, to additionally enable the latest Windows 11 ARM runner, you can now
use the following configuration:

```yaml
uses: munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-python-packaging.yml@v1.9
with:
  enable-windows11-arm: true
```

To properly support the new runners, the `msvc-dev-cmd` action has been dropped.
While initial testing has shown minimal impact, this is still a breaking change.
For example, it seems like using Ninja as a generator will lead to the wrong
compiler being used. Consider removing any `-G Ninja` flags from your CMake
invocations under Windows.
