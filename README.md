# Reusable GitHub Workflows of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)

This repository hosts the reusable GitHub workflows of the
[_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

## Key Features

This repository provides reusable GitHub workflows for the MQT, which can be
used in other repositories to automate various tasks such as:

- Change detection for selective workflow execution.
- C++ testing, linting, and coverage reporting.
- Python testing (including coverage reporting), linting, and packaging.
- Dependabot-like updates for MQT Core.
- Upstream testing against Qiskit.

Overall, these enable modern CI/CD for

- C++ projects,
- Python projects with compiled extensions, as well as
- pure Python packages.

If you have any questions, feel free to create a
[discussion](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/discussions) or
an [issue](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows/issues) on
[GitHub](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/workflows).

## Passing Project-Specific Secrets to Reusable Workflows

Most reusable build, test, lint, and packaging workflows expose a fixed
whitelist of inherited secrets as environment variables. In the calling
workflow, use `secrets: inherit` and define the corresponding repository or
environment secrets with the same names.

Secret inheritance is limited to callers in the same organization or enterprise.
Cross-organization callers cannot use `secrets: inherit`. Every reusable
workflow declares all of these secrets as optional inputs, so such callers can
pass whichever ones they need explicitly:

```yaml
secrets:
  IQM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.IQM_TOKEN }}
  IQM_QC_ALIAS: ${{ secrets.IQM_QC_ALIAS }}
  AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

The currently supported variables are

- `IQM_TOKEN`,
- `IQM_QC_ALIAS`,
- `AWS_S3_BUCKET`,
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

If one of these secrets is not defined by the calling repository or environment,
GitHub Actions leaves the corresponding environment variable empty.

## Contributors and Supporters

The _[Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)](https://mqt.readthedocs.io)_ is developed by
the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the
[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and supported by
[MQSC](https://mq.sc). Among others, it is part of the
[Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss)
ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the
[Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.
