## [Unreleased]

_If you are upgrading: please see [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md#unreleased)._

### Added

- ✨ Add `reusable-cpp-ci.yml` as an umbrella workflow that composes the granular
  C++ workflows into the whole C++ CI pipeline, mirroring `reusable-python-ci.yml`.
  It owns the platform and configuration matrix the C++ projects previously
  spelled out job by job -- release on all five platforms, debug on the three
  x86 ones, and drafts reduced to the debug builds -- and provides a stable
  `🚦 Check` job for branch protection ([#445])
- ✨ Reintroduce `reusable-python-ci.yml` as an umbrella workflow that composes
  the granular workflows into the whole Python CI pipeline, including a stable
  `🚦 Check` job for branch protection and a `python-versions` input for
  projects that deviate from the default interpreter window ([#445])
- ✨ Add a `wheels-artifact` input to `reusable-python-tests.yml` that installs
  the package from prebuilt wheels, pinned to the exact version found in the
  wheelhouse ([#445])
- ✨ Add `python-version`, `enable-coverage`, and `timeout-minutes` inputs to
  `reusable-python-tests.yml` ([#445])

### Changed

- ♻️ Merge `reusable-cpp-tests-ubuntu.yml`, `reusable-cpp-tests-macos.yml`, and
  `reusable-cpp-tests-windows.yml` into a single `reusable-cpp-tests.yml` that
  derives the platform from `runs-on` and sets up the compiler in one shared
  step ([#445])
- 🐛 Build with the ClangCL toolset when `compiler: clang` is requested on
  Windows; this was documented but never implemented ([#445])
- 🚸 Run one Python version and one Nox session per test job; the `minimums`
  session runs on Linux and Windows (x86) only, at the interpreter boundaries
  ([#445])
- 🚸 Reduce draft pull requests to a single Linux wheel build and test job
  without coverage in `reusable-python-ci.yml` ([#445])
- 🚸 Declare the full optional secret contract (`IQM_TOKEN`, `IQM_QC_ALIAS`, and
  the three AWS secrets) on every reusable workflow that reads them, for callers
  that cannot use `secrets: inherit` ([#445])
- ⚡️ Cap the compiler caches and share them through run-id-keyed Actions cache
  entries in `reusable-python-packaging-wheel-cibuildwheel.yml`,
  `reusable-cpp-coverage.yml`, and `reusable-cpp-linter.yml` ([#445])
- ⚡️ Cache the C++ test builds with sccache in `reusable-cpp-tests.yml`, which
  was the only compiling workflow without a compiler cache. Windows is excluded:
  the Visual Studio generator ignores `CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` ([#445])
- ⚡️ Save the pruned, uniquely-keyed uv caches on every run instead of only on
  `main` ([#445])
- 🐛 Make the coverage artifact name in `reusable-python-tests.yml` unique per
  matrix entry ([#445])
- 🚸 Drop the workflow-level concurrency group from
  `reusable-change-detection.yml` so a pipeline can call it more than once
  ([#445])
- 🚸 Lower the default test job timeout from 60 to 30 minutes ([#445])

### Removed

- 🔥 Remove the compiler machinery (MSVC setup, the Ninja override, mold, and
  sccache) and the "Free up space" steps from `reusable-python-tests.yml`
  ([#445])
- 🔥 Remove the `draft-sessions` input from `reusable-python-tests.yml` ([#445])
